{"name":"Mailer","tagline":"Email delivery service. Fast, easy, robust.","body":"## Installation\r\n\r\n1. npm install co-mailer --save\r\n2. update config/autoload.js\r\n3. create `config/mailer.js` configuration, see [config/mailer.example.js][1]\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nCall `compound.mailer.send('user/notification', user, event);` to send email.\r\nController have `sendEmail` method with the same signature.\r\n\r\nPut your mailer to `app/mailers/mailerName.js`. See [mailer example][2].\r\nMailer file should export set of emails, for example `app/mailers/user.js`:\r\n\r\n    exports.notification = function(user, event) {\r\n        this.layout = 'base';\r\n        this.locals.user = user;\r\n        this.locals.event = event;\r\n        this.send({\r\n            to: user.email,\r\n            subject: event.title\r\n            cc: ...,\r\n            bcc: ...,\r\n            ...\r\n            // full list of options available here:\r\n            // https://github.com/andris9/Nodemailer#e-mail-message-fields\r\n            // you can populate all except 'html' and 'text'\r\n            // which handled by mailer\r\n        });\r\n    };\r\n\r\nViews for emails should be located in `app/views/mail` directory, and layouts\r\nin `app/views/layouts/mail` directory. Naming convention as follows: `mailerName/emailType.format.js`. For example for user mailer's notification email it will be:\r\n\r\n    ./app/views/mail/user/notification.html.ejs\r\n    ./app/views/mail/user/notification.text.ejs\r\n\r\nLayout name by default is `default.{html,text}.ejs`, if mailer find\r\n`app/views/layouts/mail/user.html.ejs` it will be used for user mailer. But\r\ndefault could be overwritten in mail handler.\r\n\r\nAny compoundjs helper available in view. Path helper should be used with\r\n{baseURL: 'http://my.domain.tld'} option, or specify it `baseURL` in config.\r\nOtherwise you get useless paths in email.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/compoundjs/mailer/blob/master/assets/config/mailer.example.js)\r\n[2]: https://github.com/compoundjs/mailer/blob/master/test/app/app/mailers/user.js)\r\n\r\n## License (MIT)\r\n\r\n```text\r\nCopyright (C) 2011 by Anatoliy Chakkaev\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\n```text\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
